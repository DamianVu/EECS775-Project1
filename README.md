Project 1 for EECS775: Visualization

This is my Project 1 for EECS775: Visualization at KU. I am currently taking this course in Spring of 2018.

## Overview

The requirements for this project are to implement three interpolation techniques for image resizing in c++: 
Nearest-neighbor interpolation, Bilinear interpolation, and Bicubic Interpolation. The code I wrote can be found in <a href="https://github.com/DamianVu/EECS775-Project1/blob/master/project1/resample.c%2B%2B">project1/resample.c++</a>

A full overview of the project is found in '<a href="https://github.com/DamianVu/EECS775-Project1/blob/master/Project%20Description.html">Project Description.html</a>' in the main directory.
