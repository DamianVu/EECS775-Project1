# EECS775-Project1
Project 1 for EECS775: Visualization

This is my Project 1 for EECS775: Visualization at KU. I am currently taking this course in Spring of 2018.

## Overview

The requirements for this project are to implement three interpolation techniques for image resizing in c++: 
Nearest-neighbor interpolation, Linear interpolation, and Bicubic Interpolation. The code I wrote can be found in project1/resample.c++

A full overview of the project is found in 'Project Description.html' in the main directory.
