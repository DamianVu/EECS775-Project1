<h2>Programming Project 1</h2>
</center>

<b>Due:</b> 12 February 2018 (emailed by 11:59:59 p.m.)

<h2>Project Specification</h2>
<p>
This project is inspired by suggested project #1 on page 78 of the text. Basically this project will
allow you to get experience with the fundamental operation of resampling regular grids using different
	types of interpolation. As we have assumed in class when studying these techniques, we will assume
	that pixel values are associated with <u>vertices</u> as opposed to cells.
</p>
<p>
	Download <a href="https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~jrmiller/Courses/775/Spr2018/Projects/775Proj1.tar.gz">775Proj1.tar.gz</a> and uncompress it. This will produce a directory with
	the following structure:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em"><tt>ImageReader</tt>: A directory with classes that can open and read an
			image file in any of jpeg, png, bmp, or tga formats.</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em"><tt>ImageWriter</tt>: A directory with classes that can open and write an
			image file in any of jpeg, png, bmp, or tga formats.</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em"><tt>Packed3DArray</tt>: A templated data type used by both the <tt>ImageReader</tt>
			and <tt>ImageWriter</tt> classes to hold an internal frame buffer representation of the image and allow it to
			be read or written almost as if it were an ordinary 3D array.</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em"><tt>lib</tt>: an empty directory into which the <tt>ImageReader</tt> and
			<tt>ImageWriter</tt> compiled libraries will be stored.</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em"><tt>project1</tt>: The directory in which your code will be placed. There is an
			example program there now that simply reads an image, modifies it, and then writes it back out. This program
			will show you how to use the three classes mentioned above. The comments in the header
			files <tt>ImageReader/ImageReader.h</tt>, <tt>ImageWriter/ImageWriter.h</tt>, and
			<tt>Packed3DArray/Packed3DArray.h</tt> have extensive documentation on usage as well.
			<p>To run the example program, simply type "<tt>make</tt>" in the project1 directory, then type:</p>
			<center><tt>example file.jpg anotherfile.png</tt></center></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		When you submit your project, tar and submit <i>only</i> the <tt>project1</tt> subdirectory.
	</p>
<h3>Running your project</h3>
<p>
	Your program should be launched like:
	</p>
	<center><p><tt>% resample </tt><i>&lt;code&gt; &lt;inputImage.ext&gt; &lt;outputImage.ext&gt;</i></p></center>

	<p>where</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>&lt;code&gt;</i> is one of: <tt>n</tt> for nearest (no interpolation); <tt>l</tt> for bilinear
			interpolation; or <tt>c</tt> for bicubic interpolation.</li>
		<li>The "<tt>ext</tt>" can be any of the four supported types mentioned, and the input and output extensions need not be the same.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Then, for example, a session might look like (what you type is shown in red):
</p>
	<pre>% <font color="red">resample c file.jpg out.png</font>
Dimensions of input image: 190 x 265
Enter desired resampled width: <font color="red">380</font>
Enter desired resampled height: <font color="red">530</font>
%</pre>

<p>
	When the program ends, the result will have been written to the file "<tt>out.png</tt>".
	</p><p>
Note that your program must allow resampling to either a higher or lower resolution. Also, do not take
any special action (or even bother to check) if the aspect ratio of the input and output files differ.
</p>
	
	<h3>Analysis</h3>
	<p>
		Use your implementation with several images and systematically evaluate how the three interpolation  approaches work when
		scaling up and down with different images exhibiting different amounts of high frequency detail.  I am not necessarily
		looking for any general assessment as to what method is best with up or down scaling; instead just see if you can
		find some interesting insight into specific images that work better or worse with one technique or another. Include
		your observations in a pdf file submitted along with your project code.
	</p>

<h2>Project Submission</h2>

<p>
When you are ready to submit your project, remove all the "<tt>.o</tt>" and executable
programs in the directory containing your project. Do a <tt>cd</tt> to the parent
directory and do the following:
</p>
<pre>tar cf project1.tar project1
gzip project1.tar</pre>
<p>
Attach the resulting file (<tt>project1.tar.gz</tt>) to an email and send it to me
at jrmiller@ku.edu.
</p>
